# Software Needed
1. Unity Hub
2. Unity (**2020.3.47f1 LTS**)
3. Visual Studio Code

## Instructions
1. Install Unity Hub. Installation files have been provided for [Windows](../Software/UnityHubSetup.exe) and [MacOS](../Software/UnityHubSetup.dmg) in the [**Software**](../Software/) directory.
   > For Linux users, the instructions are [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html?_ga=2.64077743.1617637464.1684219211-410196208.1684058143#install-hub-linux).
2. Check the [minimum system requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html) for the Unity version we're using to make sure your computer meets those requirements.
3. After successfully installing the hub, install Unity version **2020.3.47f1 LTS** from the Unity hub using the [instructions here](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/project-setup-processes#60ed7a3fedbc2a001f71f1aa).
   > **Note**: Disable the option to download **“Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019”** module during the installation (we'll be using **Visual Studio Code**) and enable the **Documentation** module so you can easily reference these on your learning journey.

## Additional To-dos
1. After successfully installing Unity version **2020.3.47f1 LTS** from the Unity hub:
   - Click on **New Project** to create a new project.
   - If you have multiple unity versions installed, switch the editor version to the **2020.3.47f1 LTS** version we just installed.
   - Create the new project using the **3D Sample Scene URP** template. Name it "RollaBall", you can set the default directory to a custom location if you'd like.
   - Open the project by clicking on its name. 
     > **Note**: Opening a Unity project (especially the first time), can take some time.
   - When you're project loads, set your default scripting editor to Visual Studio code by navigating on the menu bar: `Edit` --> `Preferences` --> `External Tools` --> **`External Script Editor`** --> **`Visual Studio Code`**.
